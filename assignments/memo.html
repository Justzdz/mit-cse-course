<hr>

<p>The DP1 memo is the beginning of a conversation between you and your
manager about <a href="dp1.html">design project 1</a>. You are bringing a new idea to your manager, justifying its value, and
proposing that you work on this new project. The memo should:
<ul>
<li> describe the product (the versioning file system)
<li> explain why people will want to use it (what problems does it solve for
  them)
  <li> propose a timeline for the Design Project 1 assignment: designing the
  system, writing the proposal, and writing the report. Include a paragraph
  justifying that timeline (why are the tasks in that order, which are major and
  which are minor)
  
</ul>

<p>The memo should be no more than one page long (one sheet of paper).

For formatting specifications, consult <a
   href="../writing-program/sample-memo.pdf">sample memo</a> and the <a
   href="https://web.mit.edu/21.guide/www/memo.htm">Mayfield
  Handbook</a>.

<p>You will receive feedback from your communication instructor, including
suggestions on how to develop this memo into the design proposal. Your TAs will
also review the memo and give feedback on your technical material and your
timeline.
