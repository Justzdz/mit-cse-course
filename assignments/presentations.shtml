<p class="TitleHead">Preparation for Class Presentations (Recitation 25)</p> 

<p> <strong> Your team will present its oral report on Design Project
    2 in the second-to-last recitation<sup>&dagger;</sup>.</strong></p>

<p> In preparation for giving your talk during recitation, your
    design team should prepare a 5-minute at-the-blackboard oral
    presentation of your design.  Choose one of your members to
    deliver this presentation.  (If you wish, you can divide up the
    presentation among two or three members, but if you do that you
    will need to work skillfully to keep from tripping over each other
    in the short time available.)  You can assume that your audience
    is <em>very</em> familiar with the problem to be solved, and has a
    pretty good idea about the design space, so you do not need to
    spend much of your time giving background or explaining the design
    in detail. You should, however, make sure to explain the essential
    ideas of your design with utmost clarity and precision. Avoid
    low-level implementation details, and focus on the <i>key design
    decisions and their implications</i>. Also explain what your group
    thinks are your design's major strengths, weaknesses and
    interesting design decisions.</p>

<p> After presenting your design, the floor will be opened to the rest
    of the section for a short period of questions, comments, and
    critique of your design.  Design review is a commonly practiced
    method of checking out designs and proposals. The goal of design
    review is to be constructive, not destructive. Comments along the
    lines of "this design is trash" are out of order.  Instead you
    should try to come up with comments along the lines of "this
    design doesn't handle X, but by incorporating Y
    it would be more bullet proof" or "This design is excellent,
    because it meets all of the stated goals and manages to add two
    neat features, Y and Z."  You should try to enhance this goal by
    maintaining a professional, collegial attitude during the
    presentation and ensuing discussion.</p>

<p> <b>Your group's grade on design project two will not take into
    account your oral presentation.</b>  Instead, your presentation and
    the comments you make in critiquing other designs will be
    considered as part of your recitation grade.  And don't worry
    about negative recommendations and misunderstandings by other
    classmates that critique your design; they do <em>not</em> affect
    your grade.</p>

<p> Some design teams are split between two sections; those design
    teams will make just one presentation, in the section belonging to
    the majority of the team's members.  If you are a minority member
    and have the hour available, you are welcome to attend the other
    section.  If, in order for you to attend that other section, your
    team should give its report at the beginning or end of the hour,
    let your instructor know so that they can take that into
    account when working out the presentation schedule.</p>

<p> <font size="4"><b>Organizing a presentation:</b></font>

<p> It is quite a challenge to make a short presentation that actually
    communicates the things you really want to say, so it is a good
    idea, as part of your preparation, to do a "dry run".  A dry run
    is a practice presentation in front of a mirror or a small group
    of friends, with a clock.  The dry run gives you a chance both to
    find out if your talk is intelligible, and to assess whether or
    not you have the timing right.</p>

<p> A well-organized presentation will start off with a very brief
    overview, will make use of the blackboard to illustrate
    graphically how things work, and will make the most important
    points early, so that if you do run out of time, what you don't
    get to say will be less important.  Be careful not to get bogged
    down in detail, and select carefully the things you do want to
    talk about in depth.  You can expect a "thirty seconds left"
    warning from your instructor; that is a good opportunity to
    gracefully (and quickly) wrap up whatever current point you are
    talking about, and move to a few closing words that remind the
    audience why your design is a winner.</p>

<hr width="30%">

<p>&dagger; While this presentation falls during the last week of classes, in
    consultation with the chair of the faculty we have determined that
    the assignment falls in the spirit of the end-of-term rules.</p>
