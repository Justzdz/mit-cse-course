<h2>
6.033 2012 Design Project 2
</h2>


<h2> I. Due Dates and Deliverables </h2>

You will be working on the second design project in teams of three
students who share the same recitation instructor.  There are four
deliverables for this design project:

<ol>
<li>A list of team members emailed to your TA by April 12, 2012.
<li>One copy of a design proposal (not exceeding 1,200 words),
    due at 5pm on April 26, 2012.
<li>One copy of a design report (not exceeding 5,000 words),
    due at 5pm on May 10, 2012.
<li>A five-minute in-recitation presentation, on May 15, 2012.
    In consultation with the chair of the faculty we have determined
    that the assignment follows the spirit of the end-of-term rules.
</ol>

<p>
All deliverables should be submitted via the online submission site.

<p>
As with real life system designs, 6.033 design projects are
under-specified, and it is your job to complete the specification in
a sensible way given the overall requirements of the project. As with
designs in practice, the specifications often need some adjustment as
the design is fleshed out. We recommend that you start early so that
you can evolve your design over time. A good design is likely to take
more than just a few days to put together.


<h2> II. The Problem </h2>

<p>
Ben Bitdiddle is collaborating with several of his friends on a paper for
a class (similar to the DP2 report that your team is putting together).
He wants to build a peer-to-peer text editor in which he and his group
members can edit the paper at the same time, without relying on a central
server (such as in Google Docs).  Ben and his friends often use laptops
without internet access, and they don't like relying on Athena, so they
would like to come up with a design that allows disconnected operation
and does not require a central server.  One particular scenario that Ben
and his friends want to support is being able to sit together along the
Charles River, without internet access, but still be able to collaborate
on editing the same document when their laptops can communicate.

<p>
Ben expects many group members to make changes while offline.  It may
be the case that two group members make conflicting changes to the
same sentence, in which case the editor should ask the user for help
in merging these changes.  However, in cases when the changes are not
in conflict with one another, Ben would like the text editor to merge
them automatically, without any manual input from the user.  Moreover,
once a user resolves a conflict, other users should not need to resolve
the same conflict again.

<p>
At some point Ben thinks that he has a final version of the paper ready
for submission.  He wants to double-check that the paper he submits
reflects everyone's latest changes.  To help all group members to agree on
a single version of the document to submit, the text editor should allow
Ben to commit a certain version of the document (for example, the one
that Ben is going to submit on the group's behalf to the course staff).
If there were some changes to the paper on a group member's computer,
which Ben did not see before initiating his commit, Ben's commit should
fail and Ben will have to merge those changes and initiate another commit.

<p>
Your job is to design a collaborative text editor that meets Ben's
requirements.


<h2> III.  Requirements </h2>

<p>
The challenges you should address in your design project are as follows:

<ol>

<li>
Your design must support disconnected operation.  If two group members
edit the same document, but make changes to different parts of the
document, their changes should eventually be merged together when they
re-connect to the Internet.  If they edit the same part of the document,
the text editor should flag the conflicting parts of their changes,
and ask the users to resolve this conflict.  A third member of the
group should not have to resolve this conflict once it has already
been resolved.

<li>
Your design must support direct connectivity between two users without
Internet access, such as two group members being able to communicate
over a direct link on an airplane or in a park.  The users should be
able to synchronize with each other, and later be able to send their
changes to a third user when they connect to the Internet.

<li>
Your design must support commit points.  A user should be able to
initiate commit on a document with a given name, such as ``Ben's final
submission''.  If the user's commit returns with success, all users
must agree on the document that corresponds to that commit name, even
if all machines crash after that point.  Additionally, the committed
document must reflect the changes from each user at the time the commit
was initiated.

<li>
Your design can assume that the membership of Ben's group does not change
for the lifetime of the document (although not all group members may be
online at any given time, or they may be in different network partitions).

<li>
Your design can assume that each user knows the current IP addresses of
other group members' machines.

</ol>

<p>
After you have designed your system, you should evaluate how usable
your system is, in terms of how many conflicts have to be resolved when
two users make concurrent changes to the document.  Your design should
not ask users to resolve conflicts that don't matter in the current
version of the document.  Your design should also not ask users to
resolve conflicts that can be reasonably resolved automatically, by,
for example, keeping more precise dependencies.

<p>
The scenarios your design must handle in terms of conflict resolution
are as follows:

<ol>

<li>
Two users, Alice and Bob, add lots of text to the document in different
paragraphs, and also make different changes to a single sentence in the
introduction.  Once Alice and Bob connect to each other, your design must
not require resolving conflicts for the changes to different paragraphs.

<li>
Two users, Alice and Bob, are connected to each other, and Bob makes a
change to a sentence.  Concurrently, an offline user, Charlie, changes
that same sentence in a different way.  Alice goes offline but later
meets Charlie, at which point they synchronize, detect the conflict,
and Alice resolves the conflict.  At a later point, Charlie meets Bob
and synchronizes with him.  Bob should not have to resolve a conflict
between his change and Charlie's change, because Alice already resolved
this conflict.

<li>
One user, Alice, moves several paragraphs from one section of the
paper to another, but does not change the contents of those paragraphs.
Concurrently, another user, Bob, who is offline, edits a sentence in one
of those paragraphs.  When Alice and Bob meet, no conflict resolution
should be required.

<li>
Two users, while not connected to each other, find a spelling mistake
and correct the same word in the same way.  When they re-connect, no
conflict resolution should be required.

</ol>

<p>
Your design report must discuss how you handle failures during commit,
where Ben's system crashes (when Ben initiated commit) at any point in
the commit process, what happens if another student in the group has
outstanding edits that Ben has not seen yet, and what happens if another
student's computer crashes while Ben is in the middle of committing.
Under any failures (including the ones mentioned here), once a user sees
that some version was committed under a given name, no other version can
ever be committed under that name.  If a user does not see that a version
was committed, they must be able to either commit a new version <i>or</i>
find out the version that <i>was</i> committed under that name.

<p>
Your design must correctly handle concurrent commits, when multiple users
try to commit a version with the same name.

<p>
Your design must never silently drop changes, except if the computer of
the user making the change crashes just after the user made that change,
<i>and</i> that change has not been sent out to other users yet.

<p>
<b><i>Optional challenge problem:</i></b>

<ul>
<li>Handle dynamic group membership, where a group member can leave
  the group, and one group member can add a new member.  This refers
  to the set of people that can edit the document, and not to the
  set of users that are online at some point in time.

</ul>


<h2> IV. Design proposal </h2>

<p>
The design proposal should summarize your design in 1,200 words or
fewer.  It should outline the representation of a document stored
at each node, and the protocol and algorithms the nodes use to
exchange updates.

<p>
You do not have to present a detailed rationale or analysis in
your proposal. However, if any of your design decisions are unusual
(particularly creative, experimental, or risky) or if you deviate from
the requirements, you should explain and justify those decisions in
your proposal.

<p>
You will receive feedback from your TA in time to adjust your final
report.


<h2> V. Design report </h2>

<p>
Your report should explain your design. It should discuss the major
design decisions and tradeoffs you made, and justify your choices.
It should discuss any limitations of which you are aware. You should
assume that your report is being read by someone who has read this
assignment, but has not thought carefully about this particular
design problem.  Give enough detail that your project can be turned
over successfully to an implementation team.  Your report should
convince the reader that your design satisfies the requirements
in Section III.

<p>
Use this organization for your report:

<ul> 
 
<li>Title page: Give your report a title that reflects the
subject and scope of your project. Include your names, email address,
recitation instructor, section time(s), and the date on the title page.
 
<li>No table of contents.
 
<li>Introduction: Summarize what your design is intended to achieve,
outline the design, explain the major trade-offs
and design decisions you have made, and justify those trade-offs
and decisions.
 
<li>Design: Explain your design. Identify your design's main
components, state, algorithms, and protocols. You should sub-divide
the design, with corresponding subsections in the text, so that the
reader can focus on and understand one piece at a time. Explain why
your design makes sense as well as explaining how it works. Use
diagrams, pseudo-code, and worked examples as appropriate.
 
 
<li>Analysis: Explain how you expect your design to behave in different
scenarios.  What scenarios might pose problems for performance
or correctness?  What do you expect to be the
scalability limits of your design?
 
<li>Conclusion: Briefly summarize your design and provide
recommendations for further actions and a list of any problems that must
be resolved before the design can be implemented.
 
<li>Acknowledgments and references: Give credit to individuals whom
you consulted in developing your design. Provide a list of references
at the end using the IEEE citation-sequence system ("IEEE style")
described in the
<a href="https://web.mit.edu/21.guide/www/toc.htm">Mayfield
Handbook</a>.
 
<li>Word count. Please indicate the word count of your report at the
end of the document.
 
</ul> 

<p> 
Here are a few tips:
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Use ideas and terms from the course notes when appropriate; this
will save you space (you can refer the reader to the relevant section
of the notes) and will save the reader some effort.
 
<li>Before you explain the solution to any given problem,
say what the problem is.  
 
<li>Before presenting the details of any given design component,
ensure that the purpose and requirements of that 
component are well described.
 
<li>It's often valuable to illustrate an idea using an example, but
an example is no substitute for a full explanation of the idea.
 
<li>You may want to separate the explanation of a component's
data structures (or packet formats) from its algorithms.
 
<li>Explain all figures, tables, and pseudo-code; explain what is
being presented, and what conclusions the reader should draw.
 
</ul> 
 
<p> 
While the Writing Program will not be grading DP2, you should feel
free to ask them for help.


<h2> VI. Presentation </h2>

<p>
You will have only about five minutes for your presentation. The audience
will be very familiar with the problem, so you can get right to the guts
of your solution.


<h2> VII. How we evaluate your work </h2>

Your recitation instructor will assign your report a grade that reflects
both the design itself and how well your report presents the design. These
are the main high-level grading criteria:

<ul>
<li><b>Clarity.</b>
    Is the design described well enough to be understood, evaluated, and implemented?

<li><b>Correctness.</b> Does the design achieve the requirements laid out in
    Section III?  Does your report give a convincing analysis that your design
    works under the described scenario?

<li><b>Simplicity.</b>
    Is the level of complexity in the design justified?
</ul>


<h2> VII. Clarifications </h2>

<ul>
<li>None yet.
