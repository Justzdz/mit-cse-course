<h2 class="c0"><span>6.033 2013 Design Project 1: A versioning
file system</span></h2>

<h2 class="c0 c8"><span>I. Due Dates and Deliverables</span></h2>

<p class="c0"><span>There are three deliverables for Design
Project 1:</span></p>

<ol start="1">

  <li class="c05"><span>A design memo, due on Feb 15, 2013 (before
  tutorial).</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>A design proposal not exceeding 800
  words, due on March 1, 2013 at 5pm.</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>A design report not exceeding 2,500
  words, due on March 22, 2013 at 5pm.</span></li>

</ol>

<br />

<p class="c0"><span>All deliverables should be submitted via the
online submission site.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="c3 c0"><span>As with real-life system designs, 6.033
design projects are under-specified, and it is your job to
complete the specification in a sensible way given the overall
requirements of the project. As with designs in practice, the
specifications often need some adjustment as the design is
fleshed out. We recommend that you start early so that you can
evolve your design over time. A good design is likely to take
more than just a few days to put together.</span></p>

<h2 class="c0 c8"><span>II. The Problem</span></h2>

<p class="c0"><span>Your goal is to design a versioning file
system. Many popular operating systems have a</span> <span class=
"c5"><a class="c13" href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versioning_file_system">versioning
file system</a></span><span>&nbsp;(sometimes called continuous
snapshotting file systems), which stores all versions of each
file over time. These designs are complex because they handle a
wide range of failures. Your task is simpler: design a versioning
file system that assumes no failures. That is, you can assume
that the file system will always terminate cleanly, even in the
case of unexpected failures. For instance, if a power failure
shut down the computer, assume that the file system will get a
chance to write its state to stable storage cleanly. This allows
you to design a much simpler file system than commercial ones.
(After the break, we will study designs that can handle
failures.)</span></p>

<br />

<p class="c0"><span>When a program writes a new version of a
file, your design should keep track of the</span> <span>old and
new</span> <span>versions of the file. That is, a user should be
able to see the old version in the file system namespace, and
read it (but not write it). Your main challenge will be to do this in a
storage-efficient manner: if, for example, a program changes one
block of the file, then your design should use disk space
proportional to 1 copy of the file plus one additional disk
block.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="c0"><span>Your design should support the standard Unix
file system operations (read, write, open/create, rename, link,
unlink, symlink, mkdir, chdir and stat). Your design can also be
slower in performance than a non-versioning file system, but it
should not be unusably slow. Your design should allow the user to
specify files and directories that shouldn't be versioned.
Finally, your design should be able to support garbage collection
of older versions of a file.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="c3 c0"><span>Your design paper should clearly describe
your design and the</span> <span class=
"c10">on-disk</span><span>&nbsp;and</span> <span class=
"c10">in-memory</span><span>&nbsp;data structures for
snapshotting, and how they are used to</span> <span>support the
required operations.</span></p>

<h2 class="c0 c8"><span>III. Requirements</span></h2>

<p class="c0"><span>Your system must support the following use
cases:</span></p>

<ol class="c9" start="1">
  <li class="c05"><span>Writing a few blocks of a large
  file</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Appending to a log file</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Creating a new file in a large
  directory</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Finding some string across all versions of
  a file</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Finding some string across all versions in
  a file system</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Allowing users to exclude large files
  that change often from versioning (e.g., virtual machine image
  or a database file)</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Allowing users to exclude specific
  directories from versioning (e.g, "/tmp").</span></li>
</ol>

<p class="c0 c14 c15"></p>

<p class="c0"><span>In supporting these use cases here are a
few general issues to think about:</span></p>

<ol class="c9" start="1">
  <li class="c05"><span>How do you represent files on disk? If
  an application changes one block of a large file, the new
  version should require some small constant number of additional
  disk blocks (e.g., 1).</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>What is the policy for when to create a
  new version? When an application closes a file? When an application execute 
  a write system call?</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Should directories be treated
  differently than ordinary files?</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>How do users specify which
  files/directories are excluded from versioning?</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>How do you name versions of a
  file?</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>How do users specify searches across
  many versions?</span></li>
</ol>

<br />

<p class="c0"><span>This list of issues is incomplete, but
hopefully helps you get going.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="c0"><span>You should analyze</span><span>&nbsp;your
solution under three workloads both in terms of number of disk
blocks read and amount of space used. The three workloads are:
1) repeatedly writing to a small file; and 2) repeatedly writing
a block of a large file; and 3) searching through all versions of
a small file.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="c3 c0"><span class="c11">Challenge</span><span>: save
space by extending your design to do</span> <span class=
"c10">deduplication</span><span>&nbsp;across files: if a block
appears twice in different files store it once. Addressing this
challenge is not necessary to get an A, but may be
fun.</span></p>

<h2 class="c0 c8"><span>IV. Design Proposal</span></h2>

<p class="c0"><span>The design proposal should be a concise
summary (800 words) of your overall system design.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="c0"><span>The core of the proposal should be the design
description. This section must include at least one graphic,
correctly formatted with a caption and brief description. For
example, it may be a good idea to illustrate the design of your
data structures used to store versions.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="c0"><span>You do not have to present a detailed
rationale or analysis in your proposal. However, if any of your
design decisions are unusual (particularly creative,
experimental, or risky) or if you deviate from the requirements,
you should explain and justify those decisions in your
proposal.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="c3 c0"><span>You will receive feedback on your proposal from your TA
in time to adjust your final report. You will also receive a writing program
grade for your proposal, as well as feedback from your writing instructor that
will help you improve the writing of the final report. The format and appearance
of your proposal should conform to the</span> <span class="c5"><a class="c13"
href="DP1StyleGuide13.pdf">DP1 style
guide</a></span><span>.</span><p>



<p class="c0"><span>Some writing considerations for the proposal (and report):</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Does the proposal/report summarize the proposed system as a whole?

  <li>Does the proposal/report make an argument in favor of the system (as opposed to a different design)?

  <li>Is content organized in accordance with the guidelines?

  <li>Do hierarchy and structure match guidelines and clearly signal the role of information?

  <li>Do figures clarify or illustrate an essential concept presented in the text? Are figure properly formatted, labeled, and referenced?

  <li>Does the document meet basic standards of professional grammar, syntax, spelling, etc?
</ul>

<p class="c0"><span>Here are a few tips:</span></p>

<ol class="c9" start="1">
  <li class="c05"><span>Use ideas and terms from the textbook
  and papers when appropriate; this will save you space (you can
  refer the reader to the relevant section of the textbook) and
  will save the reader some effort.</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Before you explain the solution to any
  given problem, say what the problem is.</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Before presenting the details of any
  given design component, ensure that the purpose and
  requirements of that component are well described.</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>It's often valuable to illustrate an
  idea using an example, but an example is no substitute for a
  full explanation of the idea.</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>You may want to separate the
  explanation of a component's data structures from its
  algorithms to access or use those data structures.</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Explain all figures, tables, and
  pseudo-code; explain what is being presented, and what
  conclusions the reader should draw.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class="c0 c14"></p>


<h2 class="c0 c8"><span>V. Design Report</span></h2>

<p class="c0 c2"><span>Your report should explain your design. It
should discuss the major design decisions and tradeoffs you made,
and justify your choices. It should discuss any limitations of
which you are aware. You should assume that your report is being
read by someone who has read this assignment, but has not thought
carefully about this particular design problem. Give enough
detail that your project can be turned over successfully to an
implementation team. Your report should convince the reader that
your design satisfies the requirements in</span> <span>Section
III.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c8"><span>V.A. Report organization</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>Use this organization for your
report:</span></p>

<ol class="c9" start="1">
  <li class="c05"><span>Title page: Give your report a title
  that reflects the subject and scope of your project. Include
  your name, email address, recitation instructor, section
  time(s), and the date on the title page.</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>No table of contents is
  needed.</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Introduction: Summarize what your
  design is intended to achieve, outline the design, explain the
  major trade-offs and design decisions you have made, and
  justify those trade-offs and decisions.</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Design: Explain your design. Identify
  your design's main components, state, and algorithms. You
  should sub-divide the design, with corresponding subsections in
  the text, so that the reader can focus on and understand one
  piece at a time. Explain why your design makes sense as well as
  explaining how it works. Use diagrams, pseudo-code, and worked
  examples as appropriate.</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Analysis: Explain how you expect your
  design to behave in different use cases.</span> <span>What use
  cases might pose</span> <span>problems for throughput, latency,
  or even correctness? What do you expect to be the scalability
  limits of your design?</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Conclusion: Briefly summarize your
  design and provide recommendations for further actions and a
  list of any problems that must be resolved before the design
  can be implemented.</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Acknowledgments and references: Give
  credit to individuals whom you consulted in developing your
  design. Provide a list of references at the end using the IEEE
  citation-sequence system ("IEEE style") described in the</span>
  <span class="c5"><a class="c13" href=
  "https://web.mit.edu/21.guide/www/toc.htm">Mayfield
  Handbook</a></span><span>.</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Word count. Please indicate the word
  count of your report at the end of the document. Captions of
  figures should be included in the total word count.</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Footnotes. Please do not use footnotes
  in your report.</span></li>
</ol>

<br />

<p class="c0 c14">The writing suggestions for the proposal also apply to the report.</p>

<h2 class="c0 c8"><span>V.B.</span> <span>How we evaluate your
work</span></h2>

<p class="c0"><span>Your recitation and writing instructors will
assign your report a grade that reflects both the design itself
and how well your report presents the design.</span>
<span>&nbsp;The most important aspect of your design is that we
can understand how it works and that you have clearly addressed
the requirements and provided the elements listed in Sections III
and V. Complicated designs that we cannot understand will not be
graded favorably.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"></p>

<p class="c0"><span>Some overall content
considerations:</span></p>

<ol class="c9" start="1">
  <li class="c05"><span>Design supports use cases and describes
  how they work.</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Clean yet sufficient design, minimal
  mechanism.</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Reasonable implementation
  detail.</span></li>

  <li class="c05"><span>Convincing space and performance
  evaluation.</span></li>
</ol>

<br />

<p class="c0"><span>The grading rubric for the final report is as
follows:</span></p>

</table>

<p class="c0 c14"></p>

<p class="c0"><span>The items in the grading rubric are not
independent: a design that we cannot understand will likely
result in a low score for several items.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"></p>

<p class="c0"><span>85 and above is an A grade. &nbsp;Between 60
and 85 is a B grade. &nbsp;You will have to hand in a design
project to pass 6.033.</span></p>

<h2 class="c0"><span>VIII. Collaboration</span></h2>

<p class="c0"><span>This project is an individual effort. You are
welcome to discuss the problem and ideas for solutions with your
friends, but if you include any of their ideas in your solution
you should explicitly give them credit. You must be the sole
author of your report.</span></p>

<h2 class="c0 c8"><span>IX. Clarifications</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li><span>Your design does not need to deal with
  failures (e.g., power outages, disk failures, etc.), with
  security concerns (e.g., user changing ownership of files and
  directories), or with distributed aspects.</span></li>

  <li><span>You can find previous examples of DP1
  reports under the "Excellent Writing Examples" link on the
  left-hand side of the course home page.</span></li>

  <li><span class="c10">Late submission grading
  policy</span><span>: Your DP1 report is due before 5pm on March
  22, 2013. If you submit your DP1 report late, we will penalize
  you one letter grade per 48 hours, starting from 5pm on the
  submission day. For example, if you submit the report anywhere
  from 1 minute to 48 hours late, and your report would have
  otherwise received a grade of "A", you will receive a "B"; if
  you submitted 49 hours late, you would receive a
  "C".</span></li>
