<p> Read <a href="../papers/therac.pdf"><i>Medical Devices: The Therac-25</i></a>
by Leveson (which is an updated version of <i>An Investigation of the Therac-25
Accidents</i> by Leveson and Turner) and
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/health/29radiation.html">the
NYTimes article on recent similar problems</a>.

<p>
Although there are many cases in which software design and failure has
led to the loss of life, the case of the Therac-25 is among the best
known and most widely cited because of the depth of analysis that was
performed by professor Nancy Leveson and her graduate student Clark
Turner.

The Leveson paper is quite long, and not all parts are equally
important. This is a good opportunity for you to begin practicing how
to get the interesting stuff out of a paper without getting bogged
down in minor detail:

<p><ul>
<li>Start with a quick pass, just
reading the section headings and the figure captions, to get an idea of the
layout of the paper and what kinds of things the authors seem to be trying
to communicate.  

<li>Next, skim it quickly, looking primarily at the first and last
paragraph of each section.  
<!--
<li>Read disconnected sections (sometimes called <i>boxes</i>) or
<i>sidebars</i> on pp. 20-21, p. 24 and  p. 25. These sections contain
technical information that both stands on its own and that the authors
couldn't figure out how to gracefully integrate into the main text of
the article. Often on a long article or book chapter, the sidebars
give you background material that makes the main text easier to
understand.
-->
</ul>

<p>
Now ask yourself why it was assigned as a 6.033
reading, and with that in mind, start working your way through the meat of the paper.
Some sections can be skimmed quickly, while other parts require careful
study. Not surprisingly, there is also some redundant information that
you can ignore. 

<p>As you read the paper, try to distinguish solid technical facts from
higher-level statements that the authors are trying to make about
process, procedures and policy. You might find it useful to note the
places where you agree or disagree with the authors' analysis.

<p>Finally, don't be dismayed by unfamiliar technical jargon; make a
guess about what it means and move on.  The authors may explain it two
paragraphs later, or two pages later, or perhaps never get around to
it.  There is a good chance that you will discover that it didn't
actually matter.  But if it does, you have something to ask about in
recitation.
