<h2>Hands-on 7: Cryptography and Certificates</h2>

<p>Complete the following hands-on assignment. Do the activities described, and submit your solutions using the <a href="https://6033.scripts.mit.edu:444/submit.cgi">online submission site</a> before the <b>beginning of recitation</b>.</p>

<p>
The goal of this hands-on is to give you an introduction to
mathematics and the algorithmic building blocks of moderns
cryptographic protocols. Before attempting this hands-on, you
should read Chapter 11 of the class notes. 
</p>


<h3>Part 1: Big Numbers and Brute-Force Attacks</h3>

<p>One way to unseal a sealed message is to try every
possible key. This kind of attack is known as a <i>brute-force attack</i> or
a <i>key search</i> attack. The longer the key, the harder the attack.</p>

<p>Keys are almost always represented as blocks of binary data.
Some cryptographic transformations use a fixed number of bits,
while others allow a variable
number. The table below lists some common cryptographic transformations
and the key sizes that they use:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Cipher</th><th>Key Size </th></tr>
<tr><td>The Data Encryption Standard (DES)</td>
    <td>56 bits</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2249">RC-2</a></td><td>40-1024 bits</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2250">RC-4</a></td><td>40-1024 bits</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf">
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</a>
</td><td>128, 192 or 256 bits</td></tr>
</table>


<p>Although there are many factors that come into play when evaluating
the strength of a cryptographic transformation, the length of the key
is clearly important. This is because an attacker who is in possession
of a sealed message can always mount a brute-force attack.  Since
longer keys have more possible values than shorter keys, longer keys
are more resistant to brute-force attacks. (Note: this does not mean
that cryptographic transformations that use longer keys are more
secure. It may still be possible to attack a flaw in the algorithm,
rather than simply testing every possible key. For example, the
obsolete LUCIFER cryptographic transformation uses a 128-bit shared
secret, while the DES uses a 56-bit key. But LUCIFER, unlike the DES,
was susceptible to a particular kind of attack called differential
cryptanalysis. This attack method was not publicly known at the time
that the DES was published, but it was secretly known by the National
Security Agency mathematicians who worked on DES.)
</p>

<p>
In this problem we will explore the impact of different key lengths
on system security.
</p>

<p>In general, because a key of <i>n</i> bits can have 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>
possible values, there can be at most 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> different
keys. For example, a 16-bit key can have
2<sup>16</sup> or 65,536 different values. If you had a computer that
could try 100 of these keys every second, it would take 654 seconds or
roughly 11 minutes to try all possible keys. (If you are cracking many
keys, the expected time to crack any given key is half that, as on
average you will need to try half of the keys before you find the
right one. Of course you could get lucky and try the key on your first
attempt, or you could be unlucky and have to try nearly every single key.)</p>


<p>In your study of cryptography, you will discover that many products
have the ability  to use either so-called "weak" or "export-grade"
encryption and "strong" or so-called "domestic" or "military-grade"
cryptography. Usually the "weak" cryptography is limited to an
effective secret key length of just 40 bits. The 40-bit
restriction dates from a time when the United States government had
regulations prohibiting the exportation of products containing strong
cryptographic technology. Even though these regulations were largely
eliminated more than five years ago, their legacy lives on today. For
example, Microsoft Office XP uses a 40-bit RC2 key to seal documents
that are given a "password."
</p>

<p>
With clever programming, a modern desktop computer can try over a
million RC2 keys every second.
</p> 

<p><b>Question 1.1: </b>What is the maximum amount of time that it would
take for a computer that can try 1
million RC2 keys every second to do a
brute-force attack on a Microsoft Office document sealed with a
cryptographic transformation that uses a 40-bit
shared secret?</p>

<p><b>Question 1.2: </b>Microsoft Office 2003 uses the AES cryptographic
transformation with a 128-bit shared secret to control access to
documents controlled by Windows Rights Management technologies. If AES
keys can be tried with the same speed as RC2 keys using the computer described
in Question 1.1, what is the maximum amount of time that it would
take for a brute-force attack on a
single document sealed with the Windows Rights Management technology?</p>

<p><b>Question 1.3: </b>How does your answer to question 1.2 compare to the
age of the Universe, currently estimated at somewhere between 13.5
billion and 14 billion years?</p>

<p>With advances in technology it may be possible at some point in
the future to have billions of high-speed computers in a very small volume. 
</p>

<p><b>Question 1.4:</b> If you upgrade your computer to system that has a
billion processing elements, each of which can try a billion keys in a
second, is your secret still safe from attack?</p>

<p>In fact, computers are getting faster every year. Moore's law is
commonly believed to hold that computers are doubling in speed every
18 months. What's more, faster techniques are being developed for
reversing cryptographic transformations. Thus, simple estimates for the lifetime of a sealing
key that do not take into account the relentless march of technology
are inherently flawed.</p>

<p><b>Question 1.5: </b>If you start with a computer today that can try 1 million keys
every second and every 18 months you throw away that computer buy
another for this project that is twice as fast, how long will it be
until you have tried all possible 128-bit AES sealing keys?</p>

<p>One of the challenges in mounting a successful
brute-force attack is that your program needs to be able to
have some way of recognizing when it has guessed the correct
key.  Sometimes such recognitions are easy: the sealed text decrypts
to English or another human-readable language. Your program can do a
letter-frequency analysis on the resulting text and determine if the
entropy is low or high; low-entropy indicates that the unsealing
operation was successful. Recognizing a correct key becomes trivial if
the decrypted message includes a checksum or message authentication
code (MAC). In general, the longer the ciphertext, the easier it is to
recognize when a correct key is guessed. </p>



<p><b>Extra Credit:</b> The AES standard allows for key lengths of 128
bits, 192 bits and 256 bits.
<!--Most implementations today use 128 bits
but it is expected that companies will soon start marketing implementations
that use 192 bits or even 256 bits.-->
Can
you give a practical reason why a 192-bit or a 256-bit shared secret
would provide more security than a 128-bit shared secret? </p>

<h3>Part 2: Cryptographic Hashing</h3>

<p>This section explores some properties of cryptographic hashing
functions. For more information on cryptographic hashes, see section 11.2.3 of the notes.  Cryptographic hashes are used as building blocks
of many security primitives, including digital signatures (see section 11.3 of the notes).</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip180-1.htm">SHA-1</a>
cryptographic hash function produces a 160-bit value, called a residue or a hash,
for any given input. Since 160 bits is 20 bytes, there must be many
files that have the same hash. (For example, given a file that is 21
bytes in length, there should be approximately 255 other 21-byte files
that have the same hash. This is a simple application of the
pigeonhole principle.) Nevertheless, no two files have yet been found
that have the same SHA-1 hash, known as a "collision".</p>

<p><em>Note: While no SHA-1 collisions have been
found, <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/cryptanalysis_o.html">security
flaws</a> have been identified in it, and new hash standards are
currently under development.</em></p>

<p>
A version of the SHA-1 is built into the <a
href="http://www.openssl.org">openssl</a> command-line program that is
available on Athena (<tt>/usr/athena/bin/openssl</tt>) and MacOS X
(<tt>/usr/bin/openssl</tt>). When
<b>openssl</b> is run with the <b>sha1</b> argument and one or more
filenames, the program computes the SHA-1 hash of each file and prints
the result as a hexadecimal string. If no files are presented, the program calculates the
SHA-1 of any input presented on standard input.</p>

<p>For example, to compute the SHA-1 of the file <tt>/etc/motd</tt>
you could use this command:</p>

<pre>
athena% <b>openssl sha1 /etc/motd </b>
SHA1(/etc/motd)= 1f3a70355ed8d34c5cc742fd64c2eca42b0d1846
athena%
</pre>

<p>Notice that this 160-bit output is encoded in 40 hexadecimal digits. </p>

<p>To calculate the SHA-1 of the string "MIT", you could use this command:</p>

<pre>
athena% <b>echo "MIT" | openssl sha1</b>
7bf26f2a41bb62f30b10f8a740df2508f86023e6
athena% 
</pre>

<p>(In fact, the code that is shown above is actually the SHA-1 of the
three characters M, I and T followed by a newline character.)</p>

<p><b>Question 2.1:</b> Compute the SHA-1 of the string "Massachusetts
Institute of Technology" (either with or without the newline).</p>

<p><b>Question 2.2:</b> Estimate the chance that there another file on
any computer at MIT that has the same SHA-1 value that you calculated
in question 2.1. Show your work. To do this problem, you will need a
rough estimate of the number of computers at MIT, and the number of
unique files that each of those computers contains.</p>

<p><b>Question 2.3:</b> Compute how long it would take to find a
string with the same SHA-1 hash as your answer in Question 2.1, using
today's computers.</p>

<!-- <p>
Note that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox">
Birthday Paradox</a> states that if there are 23 people in a room then
there is roughly a 50/50 chance that two people in the room share the
same birthday. (On the other hand, there is only a 0.059 chance that
someone in a room of 23 people will share your birthday.) This is
because each person in the room has a chance of matching someone
else's birthday. Consider how this relates to the task of locating
hash collisions.</p> -->




<h3>Part 3: GPG, Signatures and Certificates</h3>

<p>
This part of the hands-on assignment uses <a
href="http://www.gnupg.org">GNU Privacy Guard (GPG)</a>, a message
security program that is based on the program Pretty Good Privacy
(PGP). The GPG program implements a full suite of signing and sealing
algorithms, bulk cryptographic transformation algorithms, and routines
for the management of keys. It also interoperates with network of
so-called <i>key servers</i> on the Internet on which people can
publish their public keys.</p>

<p>
GPG operates under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">web of trust<a> model. In this model you trust a certificate because it is vouched for by someone whose identity you already trust. You may contrast this with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">certificate authority</a> model, where a centralized third party, such as Verisign, vouches for the authenticity of a certificate.  
</p>

<p>
 To complete this part of the hands-on you will need a copy of
 GPG. You
  can log in to Project Athena and type <tt>add gnu</tt>, as there is a copy of
 GPG
  in the Athena "gnu" locker. Alternatively, you can download a copy
 of
  GPG from <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GNU privacy guard</a> and install
 it on
  your own computer.


<p>To learn about GPG's commands type <tt>man gpg</tt> and <tt>gpg
--help</tt>. Note: it is a good idea to try both of these commands,
because each one will teach you something different about GPG.</p>

<p>You can use GPG's <tt>--version</tt> command
to discover the transformation algorithms, ciphers, and hashes that it
supports.</p>


<p>
The following questions make use of GPG Key BD18CA24 which was created
especially for this course and uploaded to the GPG key server
<tt>pgp.mit.edu</tt>  You will need to obtain the public key BD18CA24
and add it GPG's database of public keys, which the program calls its
<i>key ring</i>. You can either download the key from the key server
using the GPG
command <tt>gpg&nbsp;--keyserver&nbsp;pgp.mit.edu&nbsp;--recv-keys&nbsp;BD18CA24</tt>
or else you can copy the key below, run GPG with the <tt>--import</tt>
command, and paste the key into GPG's standard input.
</p>

<p>Here is the GPG key:</p>

<p>
GPG keys can be used for signing documents or for signing other
keys. By convention, signatures on documents are used to verify the
document's author and to demonstrate that the document has not been
modified since it was signed. Signatures on keys mean that the person
signing the key is making an affirmative statement that a given public
key really belongs to the person whose name is embedded inside the
key. Keys with signatures binding them to names are called
<i>certificates</i>. (See sections 11.5.1 and 11.7.4 of the notes.)
</p>

<p>
GPG supports supports a signature format called <i>clear
signature</i> in which the signature appears at the bottom of the
message. The course locker contains two messages that have GPG clear signatures
at the bottom. Both documents were signed with the key that we created
for this course, but one of the documents was modified.
