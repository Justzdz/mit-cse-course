<h2>Part I: For people thinking about taking 6.033</h2> 

<p> <strong>Q. Prerequisites.</strong> I want to take 6.033 this term,
    but I haven't taken 6.004 yet, and the catalog says that is a
    prerequisite. Is the prerequisite really needed? I might be able
    to take 6.004 at the same time. Will that work? My friend started
    6.004 but dropped it after the second quiz. Can she take 6.033?
    </p>

<p> <strong>A.  No; you need 6.004 PRIOR to 6.033.</strong> 6.004
    really is a <em>pre-</em>requisite, not a <em>co-</em>requisite
    for 6.033. 6.033 builds on material from the last half of 6.004,
    and it takes off with no review and at a substantially faster
    pace. If you haven't <em>completed</em> 6.004 in a previous term
    6.033 will be sheer torture. </p>

<p> <strong>Q. Sophomores.</strong> I'm a sophomore. I got an A in
    6.004, I've been hacking systems for four summers at Microsoft and
    Google, and I want to take 6.033 now. But I have been warned that
    sophomores have a lot of trouble with 6.033. What's the story?
    </p>

<p> <strong>A. </strong> We strongly discourage sophomores from taking
    6.033 even if they have already accumulated the nominal
    prerequisites. 6.033 depends on a lot of unwritten computer street
    knowledge, of which juniors have accumulated another year's worth
    in various ways--their UROP assignments, doing other courses on
    Athena, one more summer job, a few more Computer Science subjects,
    etc. Although we don't require it, some of the things we discuss
    will be much easier to follow if, as most upperclass members, you
    know some probability, such as found in 6.042. The success rate of
    sophomores is typically lower than for juniors and seniors. A few
    sophomores try it every year, and about half of them survive to
    the end. On the other hand, if you really have been hacking
    systems at Microsoft and Akamai for four years, you are welcome to
    give it a try. </p>

<p> <strong>Q. Late start.</strong> It is now {choose one: 1, 2, 3, 4}
    weeks into the term and I want to add 6.033. I haven't been
    participating up till now, but I'm willing to work hard to catch
    up. What are my prospects? </p>

<p> <strong>A.</strong> much of the learning experience in 6.033 comes from
    participating in recitation discussions of assigned papers.  A large part of
    your grade depends on that participation, which you cannot make up. For N
    &gt; 2 it is probably hopeless. </p>

<p> <strong>Q. Evaluations.</strong> Is the latest Eta Kappa Nu
    Underground Guide review of 6.033 on-line anywhere? </p>

<p> <strong>A.</strong> Yes. Since the 6.033 staff changes quite a bit
    from year to year, we maintain a set of links to the reviews of
    the last several years in the "MIT catalog description" part of
    the 6.033 <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/general.shtml">General Information</a> page.

</p><p> <strong>Q. Listeners.</strong> 6.033 isn't in my list of
    requirements, and I don't need a grade. But the material looks
    interesting. Can I have permission to register for it as a
    listener? </p>

<p> <strong>A. Yes and No. </strong> In 6.033, we regularly have a
    much larger enrollment than the department has teaching
    resources. At the same time, we would like to cater to students
    who want just to listen. So we offer a compromise: we have no
    objection to listeners attending the lectures, but we don't permit
    listeners to join recitations. The reason is that 6.033
    recitations are intended for discussion. Active listeners usurp
    opportunities that registered class members should have to
    participate. And passive listeners act as negative role models for
    those registered students who are hesitant to participate. Either
    way, it doesn't work very well. </p>

<h2>Part II: The mechanics of 6.033</h2> 

<p> <strong>Q. Tutorials.</strong> Are tutorials required?</p>

<p> <strong>A. Yes.</strong> They are likely to be very
    helpful to you in developing a good design project and in sharpening up your
    writing.</p>

<p> <strong>Q. Section assignments.</strong> I'd really rather be in a
    different section from the one you are trying to push me into. Why
    can't I switch to the section I want? Does one more person really
    matter? </p>

<p> <strong>A.</strong> One of the main features of 6.033 is
    discussion in recitations, of the papers we are reading, almost
    like in a humanities class. A good discussion, involving all the
    class members, doesn't often happen in a large class. Since the
    department can't afford an unlimited number of recitation
    instructors, we therefore have to push for more equally balanced
    sections than in other EECS subjects. In fact, we don't just push,
    we employ forcible measures as necessary to get the sections
    closely balanced. </p>

<p> <strong>Q. Confidential info.</strong> I'm working for a start-up
    company that is doing nearly the same thing as the second design
    project, and my non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the company
    will prevent me from doing a good job on the design project. Could
    you please assign me a different design project? </p>

<p> <strong>A.</strong> (Short answer) <i>No.</i> </p>

<p> (Longer answer) In recent years this really has become a
    frequently-asked question. After much careful thought and debate
    about priorities and the purposes of education, the conclusion of
    the teaching staff and the EECS department is that students should
    be cautious about signing NDA's that relate to things that they
    may also study in class. In 6.033 we try to come up with
    assignments, quizzes, and design projects that are both realistic
    and timely. Those are two of the same criteria that start-ups use
    to choose business opportunities. So the chance of conflict is
    actually surprisingly high. We don't want to avoid an interesting
    project idea, assignment, or quiz question just because a start-up
    is also working on it, and in the case of design projects, we
    think that our educational goals are better met by having everyone
    work on the same topic. So our formal policy is: if any 6.033
    assignment conflicts with an NDA, then your choice is to fail the
    assignment or resolve the conflict with the company with which you
    have an NDA. (Incidentally, experience suggests that working for a
    start-up, which requires 150% of your attention, is fundamentally
    incompatible with getting a good grade in 6.033. You might
    consider delaying one or the other of these activities so that
    they don't happen at the same time.) </p>

<p> <strong>Q. Medical needs.</strong> 
    The medical department has suggested that I ask
    instructors for extra time on quizzes. Can you handle that? </p>

<p> <strong>A. Talk to us.</strong> If you have special needs for
    taking quizzes (e.g., you need additional time), 6.033 will be
    happy to accommodate you, provided you can supply a letter from
    either the medical department or an academic dean,
    <i><strong>and</strong></i> you give us enough advance
    notice. </p>

<p> <a name="groups"></a><strong>Q. Teams.</strong> For the second
    design project I understand we are supposed to form teams of three
    people. One of the people I want to work with is in a different
    recitation section. Is that OK? </p>

<p> <strong>A. Unfortunately, no.</strong> Your recitation instructor,
    in consultation with your teaching assistant, assigns your design
    project grade, and your friend's recitation instructor assigns his
    or her grade. If you work together on the same team, then both
    recitation instructors will have to read your team's design
    project and agree on a grade for the team. This procedure causes
    two problems, one for the teaching staff and one for you. The
    problem for the teaching staff, which, like you, has a finite
    amount of time, is less reading time per design project. The
    problem for you is that whenever two instructors read the same
    design project, they will find two completely different lists of
    things they don't like. When they get together and compare notes,
    they will start by merging the lists of things they didn't like
    into one longer list. So your team is almost certain to get a
    lower grade than it would have if either instructor had evaluated
    it alone. We've tried it in the past and found that it simply
    doesn't work. In addition, we think there is some educational
    value in occasionally working with someone different. </p>

<!--
<p> <a name="dp1-rewrite"> <strong>Q. </strong> Should I rewrite
    design project 1? </a> </p>

<p> <strong>A.</strong> If you receive a grade of B- or less from the
    writing staff on DP1, then you will have to revise DP1 and submit
    the revised version to the writing staff for re-evaluation,
    repeatedly if necessary, until either the writing staff assigns a
    grade of B or better, or certifies to the 6.033 instructors that
    your case is hopeless. If you fail to meet this requirement, you
    will receive an F in 6.033.</p> <A name="quizzes"></A>

<p> <strong>Q. Quiz grading.</strong> I just got my quiz back. It had
    several multiple-choice questions, and it looks like they were
    graded by an ogre who doesn't appreciate the concept of partial
    credit. Why?</P>

<p> <strong>A.</strong> Actually, in 6.033 we use a quiz scoring
    procedure that includes quite a lot of partial credit. But if you
    aren't careful, you can lose credit that you gained for correct
    answers. Here is how it works: As you have noticed, each question
    has some number of assigned points. When the question offers
    several "choose all that apply" answers, the staff carefully
    reviews the various offered answers to decide which right answers
    require the deepest understanding and which wrong answers reveal
    the most egregious misconceptions. If a 10-point question has two
    answers that should be circled, the one that requires deeper
    understanding may thus be assigned 7 points and the one that can
    be circled with only a superficial acquaintance with the material
    receives 3 points. A correct response thus receives 10
    points. </p>

<p> But... the answers that should <i>not</i> have been circled are
    assigned negative points. An answer that reveals a serious
    misconception may be assigned -8 (thus losing most of the credit
    for also circling the right answers), while one that suggests that
    the examinee missed an exceptionally subtle issue may be assigned
    just -1. Most wrong answers are assigned something in between. The
    point total for an individual question has a floor of zero.</P>

<p> When a multiple-choice question offers a "choose the best answer"
    response, the right answer receives full credit, but a wrong
    answer that is almost right often gets some partial credit.</P>

<P> In all cases, circling a wrong answer and adding an explanation
    why it is really right always receives careful consideration and,
    depending on how good the explanation is, it may receive full
    credit, partial credit, or no credit.</P> <A name="quizzes"></A>

<p> <strong>Q. Presentation in final week of classes.</strong> Isn't
    having a presentation in the final week of classes against MIT
    rules?</p>

<p> <strong>A.</strong> Thanks for keeping track of the rules.  We
    appreciate students being overloaded in the last week of the term.
    When these rules were introduced, we checked with the chair of the
    faculty whether a 5-minute presentation of a project that was due
    a week earlier is in violation of the rules or not.  In this case,
    the presentation and the report should be considered as a single
    assignment that was due on the last Thursday on which assignments
    can be due, in a class with no final in the last week of classes.
    The presentation itself is a low-key event and falls under class
    participation; to keep the workload under control we have assigned
    no reading for the section in which the presentations happen.</p>

<h2>Part III: Submitting assignments</h2> 

<p> <strong>Q.  How do I hand in my assignments? </strong> </p>

<p> <strong>A.  Use our submission site.</strong>  Unless your teaching
    assistant specifically announces a different policy, please hand
    in your assignment (in PDF format) using
    our <a href="https://6033.scripts.mit.edu:444/submit.cgi">electronic
    submission system.</a>

<br>

</p><p> <strong>Q. Late assignments.</strong> I've been sick this
    weekend. Can I have an extension on my hands-on assignment? </p>

<p> <strong>A.</strong> See the official <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/general.shtml#late">late policy</a>.</p>

<p> <strong>Q. Format.</strong> What's the format for written
    assignments? </p>

<p> <strong>A.</strong> In general:</p>

<ol> 

<li> Please use a word processor (or type the assignment, if there are
     any typewriters left). Hand-written assignments don't go over
     with the graders. </li> <li> Please put your name, the name of
     your recitation instructor, and your section meeting time at the
     top of the page. (Section <em>numbers</em> are assigned by the
     registrar at random, and no one, including your instructor, can
     ever remember what number is associated with which section, so
     don't bother to list it.) If you're unsure which section you are
     in, find your name on the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/sections.shtml">section
     assignment page</a>, which is a class roll by section, and find
     your instructor's name on the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/general.shtml#meetings">list of recitations</a>. <em>For the
assignments in which your work is to be formatted as a memo, follow
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/writing-program/memo-guidelines.pdf">the instructions</a> on embedding this information in the memo headers.</em></li>

<li> Use a type font and size that is large enough to be easily
     readable (11 or 12 point is good for most fonts); single space.
For one-page essays and memos, the entire assignment should
     fit on one side of one sheet of paper. For the other written
     assignments (design project proposals, design project reports,
     etc.) follow the instructions given in the assignment. </li>

</ol> 

<p> <strong>Q. Writing.</strong> Should the first sentence of
    each paragraph be a summary of the whole paragraph? </p>

<p> <strong>A.</strong> Short answer: talk to the writing program lecturer assigned to your section; they
    are there to help you.</p>

<p> Longer answer: Usually the first sentence of the paragraph acts as
    the topic sentence for the paragraph. The topic sentence signals
    to the reader your main argument for the paragraph. It's not a
    "summary," but a "claim," i.e., a point that you want to make to
    your reader. The remainder of the paragraph provides evidence to
    support that claim (examples, etc.). </p>
